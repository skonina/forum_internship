Stuff that I worked on during FORUM Polish Photography Agency internship

###Includes:

* Chrome like tabs for clients' link management
  * preserved using SessionStorage
* Folder Zipper for clients' photo selection
  * uses AJAX calls and fancy spinner to indicate action as zipping big selections might be extremly boring for clients
* Boring Dropbox uploader script
